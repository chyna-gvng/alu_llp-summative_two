### File compression

David is to send Jane a recommendation letterLinks to an external site. (1 page) and realizes that file is too big to be sent over the network. David approach a software engineering student who completed huffman coding algorithm to compress the file. The algorithm will take the file as the input and compress it, the progress will print out the huffman code after compression.

Note:
- While grading the assessment, the program will be tested on different files
- You are expected to show the size of the file before compression and the size of the returned code.
