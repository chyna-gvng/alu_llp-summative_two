### Sub-Strings
A string is considered a sub-string if you can delete 0 or more characters but the entire parent string can not be deleted.

For example:  
Text1: Similar  
Text2: Small

The letters that exist in the two texts are (s, m, l, a)
The two maximum sub-string that exist are
- Smla
-Smal

You are required to write a program that will extract the maximum  substring from the texts. You will equally determine the running time complexity.
