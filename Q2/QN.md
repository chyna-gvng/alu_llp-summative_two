### Merge Sort and Search Algorithm
Sorting elements has always been at the core computing systems. While we are planning for the graduation at ALU, the seating arrangement will be;

- From left to the right
- From front to the back

That means that the student with highest grade will be at the front, left most seat and the lowest score student will be at the right most spot of the last row. For every student we have full name and the grade out of 100. You may refer to the table that follows:

| Full Name	| Grade |
| :---: | :---: |
| Frank Orji | 82 |  
| Walter Angoye | 83.4 |  
| Yves Ishimwe | 88.7 |  
| Thadee Gatera | 78 |  
You are required to write a program that will sort out the students based on their grades (from the highest to the lowest)

Note: 
- You are required to use structures for students' details
- You are required to use merge sort or quick sort
- When you printing out the date on the console after sorting it should print full name and the grade
- The program should ask the use to determine the number of students that will be handle (for example, if the user inputs 2 then the system will handling two students, if the user inputs 10; the system will be requiring 10 students)
- While grading, I will use different data unlike the data provided in the table.

Tasks:
- Write the program that will sort students details
- Write a make file use to execute the program
- Translate the program into a graph (allow nodes to be the number lines)
- Will the the compiler use BFS or DFS while executing the code (make file accessing nodes of the graph)
- Write a program for the right algorithm (BFS or DFS) and represent the graph as an adjacency list.
